Hi! If you're reading this, you might be in the [ utils ] folder...
Here you can Add your own code! But only if you have the experience!

Before editing any of the things inside the 
{ components.glsl } and the { functions.glsl } you need to know that there is a high risk the shader will be broken! 

So EDIT it at YOUR OWN RISK!!!
